# AI-PROJECT-DNA-SEQUENCING
This project focuses on utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm, for DNA sequencing. The LCS algorithm is widely used in bioinformatics to compare and analyze DNA sequences, identifying common subsequences and patterns among them.
